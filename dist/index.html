<p>Friday Note - 2019 05 23</p>
<p>Happy Friday {{customer.first_name}},</p>
<p>This week the wizards at HBO have been trying to figure how to magically stop everyone from canceling their subscriptions. However, Game of Thrones ending has had the opposite effect on Customer.io’s cancellations. We haven’t had a single customer cancel since the season finale. </p>
<p><em>Is that correlation or causation?</em> </p>
<p>We have 29 net new customers (new - cancels) compared with 2 net new at the same time last month.

<h3 id="the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet">The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet</h3>
<p>Yancey Strickler, former CEO of Kickstarter wrote about the trend of people retreating from public spaces on the web to more private spaces. He calls them  Dark Forests. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dark forests grow because they provide psychological and reputational cover. They allow us to be ourselves because we know who else is there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As CEO I feel a lot of stress around what I say in public spaces. That’s what recently motivated me to add an email subscribe form to my blog.  </p>
<p>Thanks for your hard work this week, and have a great long weekend (if you’re in the US or work at a bank in the UK)</p>
