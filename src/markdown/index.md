Friday Note - 2019 05 23

Happy Friday {{customer.first_name}},

This week the wizards at HBO have been trying to figure how to magically stop everyone from canceling their subscriptions. However, Game of Thrones ending has had the opposite effect on Customer.io’s cancellations. We haven’t had a single customer cancel since the season finale. 

_Is that correlation or causation?_ 

We have 29 net new customers (new - cancels) compared with 2 net new at the same time last month.

## Key Metrics (Last 7 days)
* **Sales Accepted Leads** - 73 
* **New Customers** - 9 new customers w/ $1775 in new revenue
* **Cancels** - 1 cancel - Adquick ($707 MRR) canceled last Friday after I sent the update (that’s what I get for being early.)

Look at [Current Month Progress](https://modeanalytics.com/customerio/reports/001eee4a0b64) for more detail on new, upgrades, downgrades, churns.

## New customer spotlight - Notion
[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is an All-in-one workspace for teams to collaborate. We use it. They hired Jamie Quint to do Growth. Jamie first used Customer.io back in 2012 (when we were just a babe). It’s always great when former customers pick us again! They are on our Basic plan and paying  $625 a month.

## New customer spotlight - Tiller
[Tiller](https://www.tillersystems.com/en) is “The Leading Point of Sales system in Europe”.  They charge small businesses € 79 per month and large businesses do custom pricing. They subscribed to the Basic plan and are from France.

### The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet
Yancey Strickler, former CEO of Kickstarter wrote about the trend of people retreating from public spaces on the web to more private spaces. He calls them  Dark Forests. 

> The dark forests grow because they provide psychological and reputational cover. They allow us to be ourselves because we know who else is there.

As CEO I feel a lot of stress around what I say in public spaces. That’s what recently motivated me to add an email subscribe form to my blog.  

Thanks for your hard work this week, and have a great long weekend (if you’re in the US or work at a bank in the UK)
